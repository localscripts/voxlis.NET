## Exploit Performance  

- [SirHurt](https://sirhurt.net/) is a Level 8 executor with 93% sUNC compatibility. It performs consistently and supports a wide range of scripts.  

## Background Information  

- **SirHurt** was originally launched in December 2015 as a private cheat under the name “AssHurt.” It was later renamed to "SirHurt" to make the product more marketable, particularly to younger users and their parents.  
- Due to the shutdown of **V3rmillion.net**, much of its early history has been lost, though the executor has continued to receive updates and maintain relevance in the community for nearly a decade.  
- The exploit is maintained by **IcePools**, who leads both development and operations. Past contributors include Woffle and Aero, though their current involvement is unclear.

## Developer Background  

- **IcePools** is the main developer and operator of **SirHurt**. While there have been community warnings in the past—mainly regarding personal allegations—no verifiable evidence has been presented.  
- A counter-CW was posted on **V3rm.net** which addressed and debunked the original claims using archived material. The community generally considers the matter resolved.
