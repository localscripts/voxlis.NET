## Developers Background Information  

- **Seliware** is developed by two experienced programmers — **@Dx** and **@z33r0x**. While little is publicly known about them, both were previously part of the development team behind **TRX**, a widely used executor within the CIS scene before the Byfron update.

## History  

- During its closed beta phase, **Seliware** had four core developers: **@z33r0x**, **@Dx**, **@Nezy**, and **@74235**. However, **@Nezy** and **@74235** left the project shortly before launch, creating a competing product called **Calibri**, which was discontinued soon after.  
- Following its official release, **Seliware** introduced consistent updates and practical innovations. In January, after Microsoft patched the WinVerifyTrust hook injection method, **Seliware** was the third executor to push an update — following **AWP** and **Wave**.  
- In April, due to internal issues, **Seliware** temporarily shut down for 3 weeks. Upon reopening, all active subscriptions were compensated. Currently, it stands as the most memory-efficient paid executor, making it especially appealing for farming use cases.

## Future  

- A complete rewrite of **Seliware** has been underway since December and will launch as a separate product under a new name. All users with an active **Seliware** subscription at the time of the new release will receive a full transfer.  
- Support for other platforms — including macOS and iOS — is also planned for future expansion.

## Interesting Facts  

- **GRH**, the creator of **Synapse Z**, contributed to the early development of **Seliware**.  
- **Seliware** is the second-longest surviving internal executor following the **Hyperion** update, outlived only by **Wave**.
