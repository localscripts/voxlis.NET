## Exploit Performance

- **MacSploit** functions like a standard executor but is designed specifically for macOS. While its stability is generally acceptable, it has experienced significant periods of downtime. Since it is macOS-exclusive, **voxlis.NET** cannot provide a deeper assessment at this time.

## Background Information

- In 2024, the **MacSploit** source code was leaked by **@Peyton** after **@managedhosts** was accused of engaging in shady behavior, including alleged involvement with loggers and other suspicious practices.

## Developer Information

- **MacSploit**, owned by **Raptor**, was originally founded by **@Peyton** and **@Nexus42**. Raptor initially began as a Windows executor collection. **@Peyton** retired from the project in 2022 but later returned and reignited activity around **MacSploit** following concerns about how the project was being handled.
- **@Nexus42** is currently the lead developer of **MacSploit**. However, he has a controversial reputation due to past involvement with logging tools, and the community remains critical of his role. Other contributors include **@atomic**, **@rcloll**, and **@Kohl**, who assist with the ongoing development of the project.
