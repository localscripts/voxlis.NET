				"info": "## Exploit Performance  \n- [Matcha]() is an external cheat featuring a built-in menu that provides access to preset functions such as ESP, Aimbot, Noclip, and other similar tools. It does not support standard Lua execution, as it uses a custom Lua environment that runs within the cheat rather than inside the game. [Matcha’s]() authentication system can be somewhat unintuitive, so the initial setup may require extra time. However, the registration process is somewhat complex and not user friendly.\n\n## Background Information  \n- Before [Matcha]() launched in August 2024, the project itself was relatively small and low-visibility. It originally started as a simple external tool but saw rapid improvement throughout mid-2024.  \n- After restructuring, [Matcha]() began receiving consistent daily updates—even while [@Vault]() balanced school responsibilities. [@Vain]() was appointed to manage the staff team, improving coordination and overall structure. Staff operations are now organized, contributors are compensated, and the support team is publicly listed on the [Matcha Discord server]().  \n\n## Developer Background Information  \n- [Matcha]() is primarily developed by [@Vault](), who handles the core features and security. The project began when [@slamfrags]() asked [@Vault]() to create an external, which [Vault]() accepted partly due to financial needs.  \n- The initial management team consisted of [@geekn]() and [@slamfrags](); [@geekn]() left voluntarily, while [@slamfrags]() was later removed due to financial mismanagement and unprofessional conduct. Later on, [@slamfrags]() released his own external called [Yerba]().\n- After the removal, development accelerated and [@Vault]() brought trusted friends into the project, resulting in better structure, fair treatment of staff, and a more stable workflow.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](https://reddit.com/r/robloxhackers), [voxlis.NET](https://voxlis.NET), Matcha Discord Moderators & Matcha Owner\n",

				"info": "## Exploit Performance\n- [Volcano]() presents itself as a premium-quality product despite being free. However, the free version relies on a highly inconvenient key system that often feels designed to push users toward purchasing a bypass. As a result, the free tier functions more like a demo rather than something realistically usable without paying.\n\n## Background Information\n- [Volcano](), originally known as [Electron](), was created in December 2021. At the time, it wasn’t particularly notable and served mainly as an alternative used by a small subset of the community, especially since more popular options like [KRNL]() were available.\n- In June 2023, [Electron]() made a comeback with a UWP exploit. While they were not the first to achieve this method, they dominated the market significantly—likely due to having more name recognition than competitors like [Celery](), which was relatively unknown. Their key system was easy to complete, but the key duration was inconsistent, lasting anywhere from an hour to a full day.\n- After UWP got a Byfron patch, some time later, [Electron]() was planned for release on December 1st on the Windows client, but delays pushed it back. It launched successfully, then became inactive, returned, functioned temporarily, and disappeared again—though this period is not fully documented. After the second patch, communication largely stopped on their official Telegram, and their Discord was locked.\n- On April 22, 2024, they announced via Discord that [Electron]() would return under a new name: [Volcano](), with compensation for former [Electron]() users. It took time for [Volcano]() to regain traction, but it has since grown into a solid and active user base.\n- On December 11th, 2025, [Volcano]() ditched the key system and switched to a fully paid model since Byfron’s changes made updating tough, and tons of users were bypassing the keys, costing the owner a lot of potential money.\n\n## Developer Information\n- The main owner is [@coisop](), known for contributions to [Electron]() and [Volcano](). In 2019 work began on [RyoWrapper](), later renamed [RyoProto](); in 2020 [Neutron]() released as a paid LuaJIT wrapper; in 2021 [Electron]() launched as a free LuaJIT wrapper, the same year Luau dropped; [Electron]() eventually transitioned to [Proto Conversion]() with a Lua 5.1 to Luau transpiler; after the Luau source release the project continued using [Proto Conversion]() alongside direct Luau source integration; later development progressed into [Hyperion](), which remains in use today.\n\n\n\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](https://reddit.com/r/robloxhackers), [voxlis.NET](https://voxlis.NET) & The [Volcano]() Creator",

This achievement quickly established its reputation as a highly stable and reliable Android execution platform.

On November 28th, 2025, the team announced a full return to independence with the intent of restoring performance and refining user experience.\n\n- [Cryptic]() Windows released on December 27th, 2024, in partnership with [Argon](). The Windows version was later taken offline due to developer health concerns, with a confirmed relaunch scheduled for December 2025.\n\n- [Cryptic]() iOS launched on January 22nd, 2025, but had a short initial runtime due to development setbacks, with revival plans still active.

While little is publicly known about them, both were previously part of the development team behind [TRX](/), a widely used executor within the CIS scene before the Byfron update.\n\n## History  \n- During its closed beta phase, [Seliware](/) had four core developers: [@z33r0x](/), [@Dx](/), [@Nezy](/), and [@74235](/). However, [@Nezy](/) and [@74235](/) left the project shortly before launch, creating a competing product called [Calibri](/), which was discontinued soon after.  \n- Following its official release, [Seliware](/) introduced consistent updates and practical innovations. In January, after Microsoft patched the WinVerifyTrust hook injection method, [Seliware](/) was the third executor to push an update — following [AWP](/) and [Wave](/).  \n- In April, due to internal issues, [Seliware](/) temporarily shut down for 3 weeks. Upon reopening, all active subscriptions were compensated. Currently, it stands as the most memory-efficient paid executor, making it especially appealing for farming use cases.\n\n## Future  \n- A complete rewrite of [Seliware](/) has been underway since December and will launch as a separate product under a new name. All users with an active [Seliware](/) subscription at the time of the new release will receive a full transfer.  \n- Support for other platforms — including macOS and iOS — is also planned for future expansion.\n\n## Interesting Facts  \n- [GRH](/), the creator of [Synapse Z](/), contributed to the early development of [Seliware](/).  \n- [Seliware](/) is the second-longest surviving internal executor following the [Hyperion](/) update, outlived only by [Wave](/).\n\n> Sources: [Seliware Team](), internal notes, and public release changelogs\n",

For a fuller timeline and source details, consult the Swift and MacSploit cards.\n\n\n## Developer Information  \n- [Peyton](/), the project’s creator, is an experienced and respected developer in the exploit community. His track record includes continued leadership on [Swift](/), while now also overseeing Visual’s direction. [Blinx](/), the UI designer behind both the original Swift interface and Visual’s current look, brings a clean and consistent visual identity across projects.

During a year and a half at Melatonin, [Auti ](url)developed cheats for **Roblox, FiveM, Battlefield, CS:S, Rust DMA, and Apex DMA**. While there, [Auti](url) was responsible for releasing the **first external visibility check** to the public and enabling access to Instance Attributes through the external's Lua VM. When starting [Serotonin](url), [Auti](url) partnered with his friend [@Fope](url), who is the UI creator and designer for the menu. [Fope](url) plans on releasing his **CS:2** Product and eventually expanding onto other games.\n\n## Developer Insight\n\n- [Serotonin ](url)Roblox is developed by [Auti](url), who has approximately **five to six years of experience** in reverse engineering across numerous games. \n- Auti occasionally posts Devlogs to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@autihvh)\n- The UI and menu design are created by Fope, his partner.",
