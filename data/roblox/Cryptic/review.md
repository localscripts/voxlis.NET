**Cryptic**, originally released as an Android executor on December 7th, 2025, was not just another random pop-up executor; it became the first to achieve a verified 100% sUNC score on mobile. This achievement quickly established its reputation as a highly stable and reliable Android executor.

Cryptic later entered a rough development period, when its original developer transitioned to **Delta**, temporarily forcing the project to rely on the **ArceusX** module. On November 28th, 2025 however, the team announced a full return to independence, with the intent of restoring performance and refining user experience.

**Cryptic Windows** released on December 27th, 2024, in partnership with **Argon**. The Windows version was later taken offline due to developer mental health concerns, however a re-launch was confirmed and scheduled for December 2025.

**Cryptic iOS** launched on January 22nd, 2025, but had a short initual run time due to developer setbacks, with revival plans still active.

**Cryptic macOS** was released on November 17th, 2025 - and, contrary to speculation of discontinuation, the macOS version remains fully operational and continues to receive updates.

## What we like

- Has a decompiler
