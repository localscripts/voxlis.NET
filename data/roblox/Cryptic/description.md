## Background Information

- [Cryptic**, originally released as an Android executor on December 7th, 2024, was not just another random pop-up executor; it became the first to achieve a verified 100% sUNC score. This achievement quickly established its reputation as a highly stable and reliable Android execution platform. Cryptic later entered a rough development period when its original developer transitioned to **Delta**, temporarily forcing the project to rely on the **Arceus X** module. On November 28th, 2025, the team announced a full return to independence with the intent of restoring performance and refining user experience.

- **Cryptic** Windows released on December 27th, 2024, in partnership with **Argon**. The Windows version was later taken offline due to developer health concerns, with a confirmed relaunch scheduled for December 2025.

- **Cryptic** iOS launched on January 22nd, 2025, but had a short initial runtime due to development setbacks, with revival plans still active. **Cryptic** macOS was released on November 17th, 2025, and contrary to speculation of discontinuation, the macOS build remains fully operational and continues receiving upkeep and optimization updates.
