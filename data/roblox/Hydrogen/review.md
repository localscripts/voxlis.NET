**Hydrogen** has been a long-standing executor for macOS and Android (the Android version has been discontinued). Originally developed by **@xgladius**, it was known for being an ultra-fast macOS executor. Later, development was taken over by **@retguard**, who eventually discontinued updates in May 2024 due to personal reasons. As of April 12, 2025, **@xgladius** has resumed development, with plans to continue its progress for the foreseeable future.

Hydrogen is created by @xgladius, a well-known exploit developer and reverse engineer. He is recognised for projects like [luaudec](https://github.com/xgladius/luauDec) and various other contributions to the exploit community.

## What we like

- Customisable, open-source themes
- Support for Luarmor
- Performance is comparable to a standard executor
- Has a decompiler
- High sUNC score
