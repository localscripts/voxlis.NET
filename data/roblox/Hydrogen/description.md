## Background Information

Later, development was taken over by **@retguard**, who eventually discontinued updates in May 2024 due to personal reasons. As of April 12, 2025, **@xgladius** has resumed development, with plans to continue its progress for the foreseeable future.

## Developer Background

- **Hydrogen** is created by **@xgladius**, a well-known exploit developer and reverse engineer. He is recognized for projects like [luaudec](https://github.com/xgladius/luauDec) and various other contributions to the Exploit Community.
