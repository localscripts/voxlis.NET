**Volcano**, originally known as **Electron**, was created in December 2021. At the time, it wasn’t particularly notable and served mainly as an alternative used by a small subset of the community, especially since more popular options like **KRNL** were available.

In June 2023, **Electron** made a comeback with a UWP (Universal Windows Platform - Roblox from the Microsoft Store) exploit. While they were not the first to achieve this method, they dominated the market significantly - likely due to having more name recognition than competitors like **Celery**, which was relatively unknown. Their key system was easy to complete, but the key duration was inconsistent, lasting anywhere from an hour to a full day.

After UWP received Byfron patches, some time later, **Electron** was planned for release on December 1st on the Windows client, but delays pushed it back. It launched successfully, then became inactive, returned, functioned temporarily, and disappeared again - though this period is not fully documented. After the second patch, communication largely stopped on their official Telegram, and their Discord was locked.

On April 22, 2024, they announced via Discord that Electron would return under a new name: "Volcano", with compensation for former Electron users. It took time for Volcano to regain traction, but it has since grown into a solid and active user base.

On December 11th, 2025, Volcano ditched the key system and switched to a fully paid model since Byfron's changes made updating tough, and tons of users were bypassing the keys, costing the owner a lot of money.

The main owner is **@coisop**, known for contributions to Electron and Volcano. In 2019 work began on **RyoWrapper**, later renamed **RyoProto**; in 2020 **Neutron** released as a paid LuaJIT wrapper; in 2021 Electron launched as a free LuaJIT wrapper, the same year Luau dropped; Electron eventually transitioned to **proto conversion** with a Lua 5.1 to Luau transpiler; after the Luau source release the project continued using proto conversion alongside direct Luau source integration; later development progressed into Hyperion, which remains in use today.

## What we like

- Has multi-instance support
- Has a decompiler
- 97% sUNC
- Presents itself as a premium product

## What could improve

- The free version relies on a highly inconvenient key system that often feels designed to push users towards purchasing a key. As a result, the free tier functions more like a demo, rather than something that is realistically usable without payment.
