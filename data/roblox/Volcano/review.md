## Exploit Performance
- [Volcano]() offers multi-instance support, allowing you to run multiple accounts on a single PC. It also includes a decompiler for viewing client scripts in-game and provides 97% sUNC support, enabling access to functions that are normally unavailable, such as saving configurations and more. However, considering its price, there are better alternatives available as of January 2026.

## Background Information
- [Volcano](), originally known as [Electron](), was created in December 2021. At the time, it wasn’t particularly notable and served mainly as an alternative used by a small subset of the community, especially since more popular options like [KRNL]() were available.
- In June 2023, [Electron]() made a comeback with a UWP exploit. While they were not the first to adopt this method, they dominated the market—likely due to greater name recognition than competitors like [Celery](), which was relatively unknown. Their key system was easy to complete, but the key duration was inconsistent, lasting anywhere from an hour to a full day.
- After UWP got a Byfron patch, some time later, [Electron]() was planned for release on December 1st on the Windows client, but delays pushed it back. It launched successfully, then became inactive, returned, functioned temporarily, and disappeared again—though this period is not fully documented. After the second patch, communication largely stopped on their official Telegram, and their Discord was locked.
- On April 22, 2024, they announced via Discord that [Electron]() would return under a new name: [Volcano](), with compensation for former [Electron]() users. It took time for [Volcano]() to regain traction, but it has since grown into a solid and active user base.
- On December 11th, 2025, [Volcano]() ditched the key system and switched to a fully paid model since Byfron’s changes made updating tough, and tons of users were bypassing the keys, costing the owner a lot of potential money.

## Developer Information
- The main owner is [@coisop](), known for contributions to [Electron]() and [Volcano](). In 2019 work began on [RyoWrapper](), later renamed [RyoProto](); in 2020 [Neutron]() released as a paid LuaJIT wrapper; in 2021 [Electron]() launched as a free LuaJIT wrapper, the same year Luau dropped; [Electron]() eventually transitioned to [Proto Conversion]() with a Lua 5.1 to Luau transpiler; after the Luau source release the project continued using [Proto Conversion]() alongside direct Luau source integration; later development progressed into [Hyperion](), which remains in use today.
