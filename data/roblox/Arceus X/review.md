Released in 2019, **ArceusX** was one of the first Roblox executors for mobile.

In March 2022, @lxnny - the owner of [Delta](https://deltaexploits.gg) - reposted a community warning on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net), exposing **ArceusX** for "ratting" users and scamming developers. Despite this, ArceusX remains widely used.

In April 2024, [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com) launched [Wave](https://getwave.gg), a windows executor which combined **ArceusX** with **CodeX** and an improved UI.

Although ArceusX is somewhat trusted, it is still owned by the same team which was involved with the aforementioned issues with data trust.

**ArceusX** is currently owned by **Tiahh** and [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com). There is limited public information about the developers.

## What we like

- Has support for VNG (Roblox Vietnam)

## What could improve

- Failures in the sUNC test need to be addressed
