## What we like

- Aimmy supports games other than Roblox, since it is universal
- There is no key system
- Aimmy is open-source
- An AI is trained and then used for aiming, making it indistinguishable from a real player

## Some notes

- AI like this is resource-intensive. Aimmy requires a GTX 1050/equivalent, or newer
- The AI model needs to be manually trained first
