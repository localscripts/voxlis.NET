## Exploit Performance

* Multiple stability issues. You must have [VcRedist x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [VcRedist x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed to pass the UI, and a reasonably capable CPU. We tested this executor on an **i5-4460**. After the injection, the client’s performance dropped severely — mouse and keyboard input lagged by roughly 20 seconds. Other executors do not show this behavior on the same CPU. **voxlis NETWORK** recommends this executor only for lifetime-subscription users.

## Background Information  

* Originally released under the name **Swift**, the brand was later sold and the project renamed **Bunni**. It was subsequently rebranded to **Visual** for a short period before returning to the **Bunni** name. For a fuller timeline and source details, consult the Swift and MacSploit cards.

## Developer Information  

- **Peyton**, the project’s creator, is an experienced and respected developer in the exploit community. His track record includes continued leadership on **Swift**, while now also overseeing Visual’s direction. **Blinx**, the UI designer behind both the original Swift interface and Visual’s current look, brings a clean and consistent visual identity across projects. **Reveny** and **Viz**, both software engineering majors and longtime collaborators of Peyton, contribute to the development of Visual. Though not publicly known in the community, their technical expertise ensures the project is both scalable and dependable.
