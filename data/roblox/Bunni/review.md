Originally released under the name **"Swift"**, the brand was later sold and the project was renamed to **"Bunni"**. It was subsequently rebranded to **"Visual"** for a short period of time, before returning to the "Bunni" name. For more history, please consult the Swift and MacSploit cards on this site.

**Peyton**, the project's creator, is an experienced and respected developer in the exploit community. His track record includes continued leadership on Swift, while now also overseeing Bunni's direction.

**Blinx**, the UI designer behind both the original Swift interface and Bunni's current look, brings a clean and consistent visual identity across the projects.

**Reveny** and **Viz**, both software engineering majors and long-time collaborators of Peyton, contribute to the development of Bunni. Though not publicly known in the community, their technical expertise ensures that the project is dependable.
