**Seliware** is developed by two experienced programmers - **@Dx** and **@z33r0x**. While little is publicly known about them, both were previously part of the development team behind **TRX**, a widely used executor within the CIS scene before the Byfron update.

Seliware is the second-longest surviving internal executor following the Hyperion update, outlived only by **Wave**.

During its closed beta phase, Seliware had four core developers: **@z33r0x**, @Dx, **@Nezy**, and **@74235**. However, @Nezy and @74235 left the project shortly before launch, creating a competing product called **Calibri**, which was discontinued soon after.

Following its official release, Seliware introduced consistent updates and practical innovations. In January, after Microsoft patched the WinVerifyTrust hook injection method, Seliware was the third executor to push an update - following **AWP** and Wave.

In April, due to internal issues, Seliware temporarily shut down for 3 weeks. Upon reopening, all active subscriptions were compensated. Currently, it stands as the most memory-efficient paid executor, making it especially appealing for farming use cases.

A complete rewrite of Seliware has been underway since December and will launch as a separate product under a new name. All users with an active Seliware subscription at the time of the new release will receive a full transfer. Support for other platforms like macOS and iOS is also planned for future expansion.

**GRH**, the creator of **Synapse Z**, contributed to the early development of Seliware.
