**Macsploit** is an executor specifically designed for macOS. While its stability is generally acceptable, it has experienced significant periods of downtime.

Owned by **Raptor**, Macsploit was originally founded by **@Peyton** and **@Nexus42**. Raptor initially began as a Windows executor collection. @Peyton retired from the project in 2022 but later returned and reignited activity around Macsploit, following concerns about how the project was being handled.

In 2024, the source code for Macsploit was open-sourced by @Peyton - the creator - after **@managedhosts** was accused of engaging in shady behaviour, including alleged involvement with loggers and other suspicious practices. Such allegations were found not to be true.
