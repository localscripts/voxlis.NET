## Exploit Performance  

- **ArceusX** can run most scripts due to its high UNC percentage but lacks support for some functions like `getinstance`. Alternatives like [KRNL](https://krnl.cat) and [Delta](https://deltaexploits.gg) offer slightly better UNC and have safer reputations.

## Background Information  

- Released in 2019, **ArceusX** was one of the first mobile Roblox executors. In March 2022, **@lxnny** — owner of [Delta](https://deltaexploits.gg) — reposted a community warning on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net), exposing **ArceusX** for ratting users and scamming developers. Despite this, it remains widely used. In April 2024, [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com) launched [Wave](https://getwave.gg), a Windows executor combining **ArceusX** and CodeX with an improved UI. While trusted, it’s still owned by the same team involved in past data issues. **ArceusX** continues to receive regular updates.

## Developer Background Information  

- **ArceusX** is owned by **Tiahh** and [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com). There is limited public information about the developers.
