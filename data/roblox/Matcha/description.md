## Exploit Performance  

- **Matcha** is an external cheat featuring a built-in menu that provides access to preset functions such as ESP, Aimbot, Noclip, and other similar tools. It does not support standard Lua execution, as it uses a custom Lua environment that runs within the cheat rather than inside the game. **Matcha’s** authentication system can be somewhat unintuitive, so the initial setup may require extra time. However, the registration process is somewhat complex and not user friendly.

## Background Information  

- Before **Matcha** launched in August 2024, the project itself was relatively small and low-visibility. It originally started as a simple external tool but saw rapid improvement throughout mid-2024.  
- After restructuring, **Matcha** began receiving consistent daily updates—even while **@Vault** balanced school responsibilities. **@Vain** was appointed to manage the staff team, improving coordination and overall structure. Staff operations are now organized, contributors are compensated, and the support team is publicly listed on the **Matcha Discord server**.  

## Developer Background Information  

- **Matcha** is primarily developed by **@Vault**, who handles the core features and security. The project began when **@slamfrags** asked **@Vault** to create an external, which **Vault** accepted partly due to financial needs.  
- The initial management team consisted of **@geekn** and **@slamfrags**; **@geekn** left voluntarily, while **@slamfrags** was later removed due to financial mismanagement and unprofessional conduct. Later on, **@slamfrags** released his own external called **Yerba**.
- After the removal, development accelerated and **@Vault** brought trusted friends into the project, resulting in better structure, fair treatment of staff, and a more stable workflow.
