**Matcha** is an external cheat featuring a built-in menu that provides access to preset functions such as ESP, aimbot, no-clip, and other similar tools. It does not support standard Lua execution, as it uses a custom Lua environment that runs within the cheat rather than inside the game.

## What we like

- Has a decompiler
- Has a code explorer
- Hybrid - kernel mode and user mode
- Rich in features

## What could improve

- The authentication system is somewhat unintuitive
- Initial setup may require some extra time
- Registration process is somewhat complex and not user-friendly
