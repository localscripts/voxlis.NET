**Severe** gained recognition as the first undetected external  following the rollout of Hyperion in November 2023. Since then, it has undergone continuous improvements, focusing on stability, performance, and a user-friendly interface with clean, modern visuals.

The custom Luau environment built into Severe is optimised for speed and deep memory interaction, offering advanced low-level capabilities rarely seen in external executors.

Severe originated as **v-severe**, an external that began development before Hyperion was introduced, sometime around 2021. it now includes unique features such as a **3D radar** and **in-menu chat** - with additional enhancements planned for future releases.

Severe is developed by **@BACKWOODS**, who started his journey creating and redesigning UIs in C#. He later transitioned into exploit development, releasing **Sona** and **Sona One**, two prior executors known for working at levels 6/7 (at the time).
