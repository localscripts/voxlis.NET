## Exploit Performance  

- **Severe** gained recognition as the first undetected external  following the rollout of **Hyperion** in November 2023. Since then, it has undergone continuous improvements, focusing on stability, performance, and a user-friendly interface with clean, modern visuals.  
- The custom **Luau** environment built into **Severe** is optimized for speed and deep memory interaction, offering advanced low-level capabilities rarely seen in external executors.

## Background Information  

- **Severe** originated as **v-severe**, an external that began development before **Hyperion** was introduced, sometime around 2021.  
- It now includes unique features such as a 3D radar and in-menu chat — with additional enhancements planned for future releases.

## Developers Background Information  

- **Severe** is developed by **@BACKWOODS**, who started his journey creating and redesigning UIs in C#. He later transitioned into exploit development, releasing **Sona** and **Sona One**, two prior executors known for providing Level 6–7 execution performance.
