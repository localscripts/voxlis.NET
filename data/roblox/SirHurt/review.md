**SirHurt** is a Windows executor which performs consistently and supports a wide range of scripts.  

It was originally launched in December 2015 as a private cheat under the name "**AssHurt**". It was later renamed to "SirHurt" to make the product more marketable, particularly to younger users and their parents.

Due to the shutdown of V3rmillion.net, much of its early history has been lost, though the executor has continued to receive updates and maintain relevance in the community for nearly a decade.

The exploit is maintained by **IcePools**, who leads both development and operations. He is the main developer and operator of SirHurt. While there have been community warnings in the past - mainly regarding personal allegations - no verifiable evidence has been presented. A counter-CW (community warning/claim) was posted on V3rm.net, which addresses and debunked the original accusations using archived material. The community therefore generally considers the matter resolved.

Past contributors include **Woffle** and **Aero**, though their current involvement is unclear.
