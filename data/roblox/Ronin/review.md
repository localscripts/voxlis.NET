**Ronin** is an external released on March 2nd, 2025. Recently out of beta, it performs on par with other fully released competitors. Since launch, Ronin has delivered stable and reliable results, with minimal complaints from users and resellers.

Despite being new, Ronin has already proven itself in terms of stability, efficiency, and quality. Early feedback highlights its smooth performance and solid design. It is seen as a high-potential option with strong usability and readiness for the market.

Ronin is owned by **Reaper**, who also developed **Cryptic** and **Somber** (formerly known as **Reaper Hub**). Development is now led by **@Pixi** and **@Jumble**, after Reaper stepped away from direct development.

Reaper is known for maintaining a low profile, avoiding drama, and having a clean reputation in the community. His professionalism and consistent output have earned him respect.

## What we like

- Rich in features
- User interface is written in Rust, providing a fast and efficient user experience
- Reflects the quality expected from Reaper's projects
