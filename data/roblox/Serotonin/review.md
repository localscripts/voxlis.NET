**Serotonin** is an external cheat that has quickly gained a strong reputation from a development standpoint. It offers many unique features, including a **3D ESP Preview** - a *first* for external cheats on Roblox - which is fully modular, allowing all elements to be adjusted. Other notable features include a **Player Avatar/Mesh preview** to visualize meshes and players - something never done before - and **Highlight/Mesh chams** that are comparable to the results of an internal.

Serotonin also provides a **globally functional visibility check** and lighting modules that work in almost all games. The development team maintains a consistent weekly update schedule.

Serotonin was launched by developer **@Auti**, who branched off from a previous private project called **Melatonin** and has approximately six years of experience in reverse engineering across numerous games. During a year and a half at Melatonin, Auti developed cheats for Roblox, FiveM, Battlefield, CS:S, Rust DMA, and Apex DMA. While there, Auti was responsible for releasing the **first ever external visibility check** to the public and enabling access to Instance Attributes through the external's Lua VM.

When starting Serotonin, Auti partnered with his friend **@Fope**, who is the UI creator and designer for the menu. Fope plans on releasing his CS:2 product and eventually expanding onto other games.

Auti occasionally posts Devlogs to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@autihvh).
