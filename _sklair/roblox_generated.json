At the time, it wasn’t particularly notable and served mainly as an alternative used by a small subset of the community, especially since more popular options like \u003cstrong\u003eKRNL\u003c/strong\u003e were available.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\nIn June 2023, \u003cstrong\u003eElectron\u003c/strong\u003e made a comeback with a UWP exploit. While they were not the first to adopt this method, they dominated the market—likely due to greater name recognition than competitors like \u003cstrong\u003eCelery\u003c/strong\u003e, which was relatively unknown. Their key system was easy to complete, but the key duration was inconsistent, lasting anywhere from an hour to a full day.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\nAfter UWP got a Byfron patch, some time later, \u003cstrong\u003eElectron\u003c/strong\u003e was planned for release on December 1st on the Windows client, but delays pushed it back. It launched successfully, then became inactive, returned, functioned temporarily, and disappeared again—though this period is not fully documented. After the second patch, communication largely stopped on their official Telegram, and their Discord was locked.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\nOn April 22, 2024, they announced via Discord that \u003cstrong\u003eElectron\u003c/strong\u003e would return under a new name: \u003cstrong\u003eVolcano\u003c/strong\u003e, with compensation for former \u003cstrong\u003eElectron\u003c/strong\u003e users.
