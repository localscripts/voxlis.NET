<!-- TODO -->
<!-- index.html simply redirects to the /roblox url, since that is the only thing that voxlis offers -->
<!-- however in the future, IF cs2 is added, then index.html will become an actual landing page where people can select between roblox/cs2 -->

<!-- also, at the moment index.html is basically doing AB testing management and randomly deciding whether users stay on the new site or old site -->
<!-- ...so that changes are not drastic, and users are introduced slowly -->

<!-- TODO: check all voxlis saved sessionStorage or something and see if we might conflict with already existing voxlis -->
<!-- Create ABTestManager in main website. If "UseVoxlis2.0.0" not exist then redirect to main decision page -->
