    info: "## Exploit Performance  \n- [Velocity](/) is a stable and powerful free executor with a modern backend, custom key system, and active maintenance. It delivers fast performance, regular updates, and a smooth user experience driven by community feedback.\n\n## Background Information  \n- [Velocity](/) started as [CGHub](/), a tool by [CG](/), and later became [Sonar](/). Originally a test project, it gained 20,000 users in its first week, leading to its full release and rebrand to [Velocity](/) on January 9, 2025.\n\n## Discord Server & Community  \n- Early support was unorganized with tickets flooding chat, later fixed by a dedicated server. After a short decline, new staff restored order. The community played a big role early on, and [Korabi](/) later overhauled the project with a new site, backend, key system, and moderationâ€”pushing [Velocity](/) to the top.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), Velocity Developers\n",    hide: false,
