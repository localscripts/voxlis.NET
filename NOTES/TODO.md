# To-Do list

- remove sklair binary when finished

## entire files

- index.html
- suggest/index.html

## notes on OLD

- as of now, each executor has a "more info" section. it contains markdown, which uses links instead of bold formatting to change how certain words/phrases look. a user, upon hovering on one of these, may think that it is a link and click on it. since the links are empty, it takes you back to the root of the site and completely reloads. this is completely inconvenient and also wrong.
  - TODO: ensure that bold elements in markdown are given a red colour, and stop using links for that functionality
