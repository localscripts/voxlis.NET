# Changes/Comparison with the old version of the voxlis.NET site

- the old site has incorrect usage of opengraph + twitter `og:image` and `twitter:image` meta tags. Those tags do not accept relative URLs, and instead they must be absolute to include the entire domain and the location of the image.
